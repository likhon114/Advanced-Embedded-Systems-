The python code is given in the attachment. To run this code, we need to add the following library file in the directory.
1.	LCD.py
2.	GPS.py
3.	ble_advertising.py
4.	ble_simple_peripheral.py
I have made the GPS library file to extract the location value from raw gps data. Also, there is function for converting latitude longitude data to x,y coordinate and vice versa.
I used interrupt to button 15 and button 14 according to the question.
